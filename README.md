2. **Android**: Press `a` to open Android Emulator
3. **Physical Device**: Scan the QR code with Expo Go app

## 🎯 How It Works

### 1. Choose Your Mood
Select from six emotional states, each with its own color palette and artistic characteristics:
- 😊 **Happy**: Bright, energetic yellows and warm tones
- 😌 **Calm**: Peaceful greens and soothing colors
- ⚡ **Energetic**: Dynamic reds and vibrant oranges
- 🎨 **Creative**: Imaginative purples and artistic hues
- 🌧️ **Melancholy**: Thoughtful grays and deep blues
- 🌙 **Mysterious**: Enigmatic darks and profound shades

### 2. Add Keywords (Optional)
Enhance your artwork with descriptive words that influence the generation algorithm. Examples:
- Nature: `flowing, organic, natural`
- Urban: `geometric, structured, modern`
- Dreams: `ethereal, floating, surreal`

### 3. Select Art Style
Choose from four distinct artistic approaches:
- **Abstract**: Flowing shapes and organic forms
- **Geometric**: Sharp angles and structured patterns
- **Mandala**: Circular, meditative patterns
- **Waves**: Fluid, wave-like movements

### 4. Customize & Generate
Adjust the complexity slider to control detail level, then generate your unique artwork using our sophisticated algorithmic art engine.

## 🧠 The Art Generation Algorithm

MoodPainter uses a sophisticated multi-layered approach to create artwork:

1. **Mood Analysis**: Converts emotional states into color palettes and shape characteristics
2. **Keyword Processing**: Influences pattern density, flow, and artistic elements
3. **Style Application**: Applies mathematical algorithms specific to each art style
4. **Complexity Scaling**: Adjusts detail level and element count based on user preference
5. **SVG Generation**: Creates scalable vector graphics for crisp, high-quality output

### Algorithm Features
- **Procedural Generation**: Each artwork is mathematically unique
- **Emotion Mapping**: Colors and patterns reflect psychological associations
- **Organic Variation**: Random elements ensure no two artworks are identical
- **Performance Optimized**: Fast generation with smooth animations

## 🎨 Art Styles Deep Dive

### Abstract Style
Uses organic blob shapes and flowing forms that mirror natural emotion patterns. The algorithm generates between 5-20 elements with varying sizes and opacities.

### Geometric Style
Creates structured compositions using triangles, rectangles, and hexagons with mathematical precision and controlled randomness.

### Mandala Style
Generates circular, meditative patterns with multiple layers radiating from a center point, perfect for calm and creative moods.

### Wave Style
Produces fluid, wave-like patterns using sine wave mathematics with varying frequencies and amplitudes.
